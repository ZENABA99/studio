/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the AloeVeraShop application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied at the root `/users` level to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Authorization relies solely on `request.auth.uid`, with no custom claims used.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document `id` is enforced on both create and update operations to maintain ownership.
